				<h2>Limited edition sneakers and ‘hypebeast’ brand collaborations</h2>
				<p>Collaboration trainers are the source of much of the resell industry’s value. Many of these trainers are hyped for months, and when they finally drop, they’re sold out in minutes. That’s where the boggling sneaker resale market comes in, bringing with it a huge jump in price. Sites like Goat and StockX bridge the gap between customers hungry to purchase streetwear fashion trends – also known as “hypebeasts” – and the scarcity of these styles. Collaboration trainers can make prices spike up by a couple hundred dollars, or by a thousand … or even more.</p>
